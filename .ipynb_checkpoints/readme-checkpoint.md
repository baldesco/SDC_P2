    "## Project 2: Advanced Lane Lines Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Eduardo Escobar\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a continuation of project 1. Here, more advanced computer vision techniques are used to improve the process of detecting lane lines in the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this project can be found at the **P2.ipyb** notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Camera calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is to get the distortion coefficients and the camera matrix for the camera that is recording the images in the car. Having these values will allow us to correct the distortion in the images.\n",

    "## 2. Undistort and threshold images\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the lane line images are undistorted using the output from section 1, and then a combination of color and gradient thresholds are applied to obtain a binary image detecting the lane lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Color thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I transform the undistorted image to the HLS color space, since all 3 channels in this space (hue, lightness and saturation) are useful options for thresholding the image, either by color or by gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"media/hls.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Gradient thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the lane lines are mostly vertical, a gradient in the x direction is considered. For this, the `cv2.Sobel` function is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient is applied over the lightness channel, over the HLS color space. I chose this channel (over, for example the 'red' channel or the grayscale image) because it seems to give better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"media/x_gradient.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Combination of color and gradient thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a binary mask of the lines, the hue, saturation and x gradient thresholds are combined. Since there are 3 different criteria to detect if there is a line or not, I chose to make a vote, so if at least 2 of the thresholds determine that a pixel in the image contains relevant information, then this pixel is activated in the combined binary mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"media/binary_mask.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Perspective transform\n",
    "\n",
    "After a binary image has been created with the help of color and gradient thresholds, it is necessary to perform a perspective transform, in order to obtain a top view of the region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For doing this, source and destinations image points must be defined. I used the points showed in the file *example_writeup.pdf* as a guide for this, changing the source points location just a little.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Line detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This section deals with the problem of finding a 2nd order equation to approximate the location of both the left and right lane lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task can be divided into smaller actions, shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Define a class to receive the characteristics of each line detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a suggestion given by Udacity, and it helps in keeping track of previous parameters of the lane lines. This can be really useful when the algorithm has trouble finding the lines in a specific frame or group of frames in a video/recording. \n",
    "\n",
    "The class is provided with several attributes and two methods, to initialize and update the linesâ€™ parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Find the lines \"from scratch\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions are defined to detect the lines. The first function implements a histogram/sliding windows approach to detect where in the warped image are the lines located (x and y coordinates). This function receives the binary warped image and returns the list of x and y coordinates for the points that fall into both the left and right lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second function receives these lists of coordinates and fits a second-degree polynomial for each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Find the lines from prior\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the lines don't necessarily move a lot from frame to frame, the results found in a previous frame can be used as a starting point for the next one. This is more time efficient because the algorithms look for the lines in a smaller area of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions are defined, very similar to the ones defined in section 4.2. The main difference is the function `search_around_poly`, which does not perform a sliding window search, but only search inside a defined margin around the lane line found on a previous frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Find the curvature of the lines and the distance to the center of the lane\n",
    "\n",
    "When the polynomials for both lines have been found, two more values can be calculated: the curvature for each of the lines and the distance from the center of the car to the center of the lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values need to be given in a distance metric, such as meters or miles, in order to be interpretable and useful. Taking this into account, it is necessary to include the conversion from pixels to the defined distance metric in the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Create and update the line objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Two objects of the *Line* class are created; one for each line. Then, the polynomial for each line is calculated, a simple sanity check is performed and the *Line* objects are updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6 Graph the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the two lines can be combined to create and plot a polygon in the undistorted image. In order to do this, it is necessary to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new image, *warp_zero*.\n",
    "2. Create a polygon with the points from the two lines that were found, and plot it in *warp_zero*.\n",
    "3. Apply the inverse perspective matrix to *warp_zero*, in order to take it to the original point of view.\n",
    "4. Use the `cv2.addWeighted` function to add the *warp_zero* image to the *undistorted* image.\n",
    "5. Plot the result\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have all the steps necessary to find lane lines in images and videos. The last thing to do before testing it is to combine all the defined functions into a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the code for the pipeline:\n",
